This project was born with the intention of creating a small gps tracking without relying on third-party services.

# What it looks like
Gps-tracking is composed of a control unit (Arduino nano), which is connected to an SD module that stores the position detected (every 3 seconds) by the GPS module, all powered by a PiSugar battery with an autonomy of 7 to 8 hours.
